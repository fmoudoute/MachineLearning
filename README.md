# MachineLearning
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We should create a report describing how we built your model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices we did. We will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
